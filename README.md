# GREETR.js
## A greeting javascript library

This is a simple library for creating greeting in several languges. You can easily add more languages and types of greetings. It currently supports three languages, English(default), Spanish, and Japanese for both formal and informal greetings. This library requires jQuery and also follows a similar structure like the jQuery library.
